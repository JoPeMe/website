			<section id="intro">Marvel Studios, over the course of 23 movies, started to introduce Infinity Stones into their cinematic universe. <br>Early on in the movies they started laying out clues for what the purpose of the infinity stones might be, where they might be located, <br>and why Thanos was trying to collect them all. <br>This website will go over a common fan theory that was, at the time, very likely to be true. <br>For some reason, in Avengers: Infinity War, Marvel Studios decided to go against some of the set-ups they had <br>previously established and go in a completely different direction with one of the stones.<br>
			Nontheless, the fan theory is still pretty cool, in my opinion, and I wanted to dedicate my website to it.

				<p>
					This fan theory states that the name "Thanos" is actually an acronym; each letter in his name stands for the name of the container that houses its respective Infinity Stone.

					The fact that each container happened to line up with a letter in Thanos' name made people wonder, <em>"Where is the Soul Stone contained?"</em><br>
					A couple of scenes in the Thor movies and in Avengers: Age of Ultron made people believe that the Soul Stone was contained in the eyes of <b>H</b>eimdall. <br><br>
